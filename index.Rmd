## **About me:**
#### I am a quantitative community ecologist studying how biogeographic variation, temporal dynamics, and genetic diversity influence interactions between plants and insects. As a PhD student in [Will Wetzel's Lab](https://wetzellab.com/) in the [Department of Entomology at Michigan State University](https://www.canr.msu.edu/ent/), I employ meta-analysis methods, field experiments, and statistical methods development to understand how diversity across temporal scales affect ecology. 

<br />

#### In the past, I researched Hispaniolan frog and toad phylogenetics and urban ecosystem serices in the Philadelphia region. Presently, I study plant-herbivore temporal dynamics in the model tall goldenrod (_Solidago altissima_) system in southwestern Michigan. In 2021, I will study tropical plant-herbivore interactions in urban landscapes and rupestrian grasslands as a Fulbright researcher with Dr. Tatiana Cornelissen's lab at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

<br />

#### We need open data and transparent analyses to advance science. However, science cannot progress in a bubble, and "open" science must include stakeholders not historically included in the scientific process. For that reason, I develop tools for field biologists to communicate their research with public audiences by leveraging the quantitative skills used for data analysis and publication. These tools, called [`c4bi` (Coding for broader impact)](https://dbturner.github.io/c4bi), are created in collaboration with [Drs. Matthew Helmus and Jocelyn Behm at Temple University](https://www.iecolab.org/). Please reach out if you would like to collaborate on future efforts to spread the joys of data visualization and analysis beyond traditional scientific publications.
