### I am a community ecologist studying how biogeographic variation, temporal dynamics, and genetic diversity influence interactions between plants and insects. As a PhD student in [Will Wetzel's Lab](https://wetzellab.com/) in the [Department of Entomology at Michigan State University](https://www.canr.msu.edu/ent/), I use meta-analysis methods, field and greenhouse experiments, and observational studies to understand how plant diversity across scales affects insect community diversity. I also develop tools for field biologists to communicate their research with public audiences by leveraging the quantitative skills they typically use for data analysis and publication.
